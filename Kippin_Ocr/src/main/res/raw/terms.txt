<h2>
    Website Access
</h2>
<p>
    Kippin hereby grants you permission to use the Website Service in accordance with these Terms of Use, provided that:
</p>
<p>
    1) your use of the Website Service is solely for your personal use;
</p>
<p>
    2) you will not copy or distribute any part of the Website Service in any medium or manner inconsistent with these Terms of Use without Kippin's prior
    written consent;
</p>
<p>
    3) you will not alter or modify any part of the Website Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Website Service for its intended
    purpose; and
</p>
<p>
    4) you will otherwise comply with these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    In order to access some features of the Website Service, you will have to create an account. You may never use another's account without permission. When
    creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you
    must keep your account password secure. You must notify Kippin immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Kippin
    will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Kippin or others due to such
    unauthorized use.
</p>
<p>
    Kippin reserves the right to establish data transfer restrictions and/or limit the total amount of data transfer associated with your account. User
    accounts may be closed by Kippin should the total amount of data transfer exceed an amount deemed excessive in Kippin&#8217;s sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
    You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Website
    Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Kippin servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period
    by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kippin grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders
    to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such
    materials. Kippin reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally
    identifiable information, including account names, from the Website.
</p>
<p>
    In order to post or publish User Submissions on the Website, you will be required to encode your media data by downloading and installing the Kippin
    software. For these limited purposes only, you are hereby granted a revocable non-exclusive licence to use the Kippin software for the sole purpose of
    encoding digital audiovisual material in order to create User Submissions for the Website. Kippin makes no warranty concerning the functionality of the
    Kippin software on any individual computer and expressly disclaims any and all liability for any problem which may be caused to your computer or damage of
    any kind incurred by you resulting from your use of the Kippin software. You hereby waive any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against
